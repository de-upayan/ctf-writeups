## My solution

I checked out the website [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/), and on the page for [GREP CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf/918), I found the following string: 

`475245507b57336c63306d655f74305f475233505f4354467d`

Converting this string from **HEX** encoding to ASCII gave me the flag.

```console

upayan@CTF$ echo 475245507b57336c63306d655f74305f475233505f4354467d | xxd -r -p
GREP{W3lc0me_t0_GR3P_CTF}

```
